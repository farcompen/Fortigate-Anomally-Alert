This application sends e-mail when an anomally traffic appears on your Fortigate Firewall logs 

Application really works fine with Fortigate 600D firmware 5.2 </br>
First of all you must configure DOS policy on your fortigate firewall.
You must enable ssh on interface that you will connect to fortigate firewall
